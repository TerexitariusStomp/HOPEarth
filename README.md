# What

Gas fees range from $15 (Ethereum) to small amounts like $0.002 (Polygon) per transaction.&#x20;

**However, when a transaction has a value less than the gas cost (for example less than $0.002) then what happens?**&#x20;

The transaction is delayed and accumulated or it is bundled with other transactions until an amount greater than that of the gas cost is reached.&#x20;

### Solution

To eliminate this delay transaction fees need to be eliminated or heavily minimized. This is why we use Earth 64 and have called our bundle HOPE.&#x20;
