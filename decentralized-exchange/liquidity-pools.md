# Liquidity Pools

All tokens connected to the HOPEarth ecosystem have relative values to each other based upon liquidity pools. For example, 1 carbon credit token is equivalent to the value of 100 micro carbon credit tokens. These carbon credits are also tied to the value of other tokens in the ecosystem. The central token which all other tokens value are tied to is the HOPE token.&#x20;
