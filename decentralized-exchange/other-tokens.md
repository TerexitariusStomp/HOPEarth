# Other Tokens

Creators of other tokens are responsible for maintaining their value in relation to the carbon credit as well as the sato servers that contain the tokens. Sato servers that contain tokens when bonded in the DEX will accumulate the Sato Servers within the DEX. In order for the token creators to get the Sato Servers back they need to buy the Tokens and Sato Servers from the DEX.&#x20;
