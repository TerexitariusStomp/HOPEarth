# Earth64

In the HOPEarth ecosystem tokens (like loyalty points) are swapped for micro carbon credits (µCC). This process involves Sato-Servers from two Earth⁶⁴ bundles: HOPEarth's bundle and the bundle of the token to be swapped (such as a loyalty point bundle). Tokens are described in terms of minibundles, which are Sato-Servers on some low level of the Earth⁶⁴ tree, meaning that they contain a small number of nodes. In the current system design flow chart these minibundles are level 58, meaning that they contain 32 leaf Sato-Servers. Alternatively sized minibundles are possible.&#x20;
